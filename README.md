# Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/jamesshenry/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jamesshenry/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/jamesshenry/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jamesshenry/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

My personal Scoop bucket, a collection of applications that I either developed myself or find incredibly useful and are not yet available in the main Scoop buckets.

## How to Add This Bucket

To add this bucket to your Scoop installation, open PowerShell and run the following command:

```pwsh
scoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/jamesshenry/scoop-bucket
scoop install scoop-bucket/<manifestname>
```
